Part 1 of this challenge was to use Python and SQLAlchemy complete climate analysis and data exploration for Honolulu, Hawaii. SQLAlchemy ORM queries were used in addition to Pandas and Matplotlib. 

Part 2 of this challenge was to design a Climate App using Flask API using the queries developed in Part 1.
